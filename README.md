WINE CLASSIFICATION USING NEURAL NETWORK

In this lab work assignment, your task is to perform systematic analysis on the performance of
neural network models in classifying the type of wine (red wine / white wine) based on the
given features. You will need to prepare the dataset, train, and evaluate different classifiers
models, and compare their performance. The dataset for this task is provided, named
‘winequality-white.csv’ and ‘winequality-red.csv’.
